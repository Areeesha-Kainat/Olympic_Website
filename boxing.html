                            Boxing has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since its introduction to the
                            program at the 1904 Summer Olympics, except for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm,
                            because Swedish law banned the sport at the time. The 2008 Summer Olympics were the final
                            games with boxing as a male only event. Since the 2012 Summer Olympics, women's boxing is
                            part of the program.
