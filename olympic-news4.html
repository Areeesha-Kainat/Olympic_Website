            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Eve Muirhead: Leadership lessons from a curling <br> Olympic gold
                medallist</h2><br>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">In an exclusive interview with Olympics.com, the Beijing
                2022 Olympic champion reveals the key learnings from her career that she will impart as Great Britain’s
                Chef de Mission for the Winter Youth Olympic Games Gangwon 2024.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="news-main" style="height: 570px; width: 1000px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; "><img

        <div style="height: auto; width: 900px; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto;">
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">It makes sense that Eve Muirhead was asked to be Great
                Britain’s Chef de Mission for the Winter Youth Olympic Games Gangwon 2024.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">For starters, the Scotswoman has been the skip of her
                curling teams for as long as she can remember and has plenty of leadership experience.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Her CV also reads four-time junior world champion, so she
                understands what it is like to compete on the big stage at a young age.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">And an Olympic bronze medal at Sochi 2014 followed by
                gold at Beijing 2022 demonstrate Muirhead’s resilience and excellence in equal measure.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">She will be calling upon all of this experience when
                leading Team GB at Gangwon 2024 in the Republic of Korea from 19 January to 1 February next year.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">“I've been a leader the majority of my career. In terms
                of what I can share in my role, support is number one, how to perform under pressure and how to lead the
                team back from failure,” Muirhead told Olympics.com.</p>

        <div style="height: auto; width: 900px; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto;">
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Since retiring from curling in August 2022, Muirhead has
                worked in commentary and other media roles.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">It was only since going ‘behind the scenes’ that she
                realised how much work went into staging a sports event.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">As Chef de Mission, for example, the former curling star
                needs to ensure that her athletes stay connected and supported despite being based across two different
                Olympic villages at Gangwon 2024, with one athlete potentially being the only Team GB member in their
                village.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">“When you're on the other side of the fence, you realise
                how much goes into making events happen. As an athlete, you take it for granted and I did,” she said.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">“But that's how you want it and that's how I want it to
                run for Gangwon 2024. I want those guys to not know anything that's happening behind the scenes. I want
                them to go there and have a fun and friendly experience.”</p>
