                The 1900 Olympics were a huge first for women. Female athletes weren’t allowed to compete in the Olympics until the Paris Games, when their participation in lawn tennis and golf events secured a position for women in the future. The London 2012 Olympics signified a new gender milestone with the debut of Women’s Boxing, and it was the first Olympic Games in history with female athletes from every competing country.

                    At the height of the civil rights movement in the United States, Black American athletes were encouraged to boycott the Games. Instead, African American sprinters John Carlos (right) and Tommie Smith (left) staged a nonviolent protest by raising their fists in a Black Power salute while the national anthem played during their medal ceremony. Although they were consequently suspended from the Olympic Village, their silent demonstration brought the American battle over civil rights to the international stage.
