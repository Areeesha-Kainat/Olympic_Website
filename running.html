                            movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. The athletics program traces its earliest roots to
                            events used in the ancient Greek Olympics. The modern program includes track and field
                            events, road running events, and race walking events. Cross country running was also on the
                            program in earlier editions but it was dropped after the 1924 Summer Olympics.
