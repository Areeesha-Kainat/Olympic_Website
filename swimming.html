                            Swimming has been a sport at every modern Summer Olympics. It has been open to women since
                            1912. At the Olympics, swimming has the second-highest number of medal-contested events
                            (after athletics).

                        </b><br>
                        Phelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State
                        University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant
                        because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] However, Phelps has said, "Training with Bob
                        is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.

                        Phelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other
                        swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of
                        33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[citation needed] However, Johnny Weissmuller is
                        reported to have broken 67 official world records.[300]
