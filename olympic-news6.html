        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">USWNT beat Ireland in first of two <br> pre-World Cup tests</h2><br>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">The U.S. women's football team's victory was overshadowed due to a serious left knee injury suffered by star Mallory Swanson, who had to be rushed to hospital at half-time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="news-main" style="height: 570px; width: 1000px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; "><img src="Images/olympic-news6.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></div><br><br>
        <div style="height: auto; width: 900px; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto;">
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">The USWNT defeated Ireland 2-0 with goals scored by Emily Fox and Lindsey Horan at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas, in what was one of the final tests for the two-time holding champions ahead of one of football's biggest tournaments, the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">And a true test it proved to be for Vlatko Andonovski’s side as Ireland produced the game's first significant chance nearly a quarter of the way in the first half. Louise Quinn found space on the back post and headed a corner kick on target only for  Alex Morgan to block the shot with her knee.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Minutes later the Irish were back on the front foot as they unleashed a flurry of shots on the U.S. goal, only to be denied by an alert and resolute American backline. Mallory Swanson suffered a serious-looking head injury after the U.S.’ counter-attack at the end of that sequence, but following an extended medical assessment, she was able to continue to play.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">The breakthrough came in the 37th minute from an unexpected source as right-back Fox scored her first goal for her nation. The defender, who plays her club football for North Carolina Courage, struck a low and accurate shot just over 20 metres from goal into the bottom corner.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Unfortunately, later in the half, Swanson suffered yet another injury, this time to her left knee, and had to be stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital. She was replaced by Trinity Rodman.</p></div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="news-main" style="height: 570px; width: 1000px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; "><img src="Images/olympic-news6(2).jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></div><br><br>

      
      <div style="height: auto; width: 900px; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto;">
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Rodman was on the end of a couple of chances early in the second half, but was unable to convert them.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">On an encouraging note for the USWNT, Julie Ertz returned to the pitch for the first time since the Olympic Football Tournament bronze medal match on 5 August 2021.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Rose Lavelle nearly had the U.S.’ second goal of the day with two quickfire chances, but Irish keeper Courtney Brosnan and her backline stood up to both tests.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">However, Ireland and Brosnan could not keep the U.S. out any longer as Horan converted from the penalty spot in the 79th minute after she was brought down and had her shirt pulled in the area by Diane Caldwell.</p><br>
        <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">The USWNT will face Vietnam, Netherlands and Portugal in Group E at the World Cup, which will take place from 20 July to 20 August 2023, while Ireland are in a tough-looking Group B with hosts Australia, Canada and Nigeria.</p>
