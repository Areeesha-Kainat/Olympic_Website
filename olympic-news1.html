            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Ailing (Eileen) Gu: "Outside of skiing <br> I am a huge nerd!"</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; font-family: cursive;">In an exclusive interview with Olympics.com, the double
                Olympic champion reveals why she's studying quantum physics and her belief in the importance of
                education, plus vital lessons learnt from her mother.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="news-main" style="height: 570px; width: 1000px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; "><img
                src="Images/olympic-news1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></div><br><br>
        <div style="height: auto; width: 900px; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto;">
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">When Ailing (Eileen) Gu is flying through the air during
                her freestyle skiing routines, it often seems like <br> she is challenging the laws of gravity.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">It is fitting, therefore, that the double Olympic
                champion from Beijing 2022 studies quantum physics at Stanford University in the United States.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">“I really like to learn and to stretch my mind. That's
                what I really love about quantum physics; it's very conceptual and it makes you question the nature of
                reality. That's very fascinating to me because in my own way, when I'm skiing, I guess I'm bending the
                laws of what's possible in the first place.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">“Achieving the impossible has always been something that
                has drawn me in, so that's where I see the parallel between quantum physics and skiing.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <h2 style="margin-left:60px; text-decoration: underline;">Ailing (Eileen) Gu: At home in the <br> classroom and
            on the slopes</h2><br>
        <div style="height: auto; width: 900px; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto;">
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Growing up in the United States, Gu showed as much talent
                for academia as she did on the slopes, reportedly scoring 1580 out of 1600 on her SAT exams.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">A year after winning two golds and a silver at the Winter
                Youth Olympic Games Lausanne 2020 while representing the People’s Republic of China, she graduated high
                school early and gained early admission to study at Stanford, her mother’s alma mater.</p><br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">Gu deferred her entry in order to focus on the Winter
                Olympics Beijing 2022, where a magnificent performance saw the then 18-year-old become the youngest
                freeski Olympic champion in history with gold in Big Air and halfpipe, as well as slopestyle silver.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 24px; ">The sporting prodigy and fashion model then began her
                studies in late 2022. But rather than considering herself a part-timer in any of her pursuits, she sees
                herself as a ‘full-timer' in everything that she does.</p>
