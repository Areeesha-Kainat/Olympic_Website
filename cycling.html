                            Cycling has been contested at every Summer Olympic Games since the birth of the modern
                            Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics, at which a road race and five track events
                            were held. Mountain bike racing entered the Olympic programme at the Atlanta Olympics,
                            followed by BMX racing in 2008 and freestyle BMX in 2021. Prior to the 2020 Summer Olympics
                            all events were speed races,
                            but the 2020 programme featured BMX freestyle for the first time.
